```

### 📊 Face Verification Details:

**Similarity Threshold:** 60% (0.6)
**Required Matches:** 2 out of 10 samples
**Comparison Method:** Euclidean distance between facial landmarks
**Security:** OTP + Face verification required

**Sample Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "FACE_1771946750921_1234567890": {
    "faceId": "FACE_1771946750921_1234567890",
    "userId": "1771946750921",
    "samples": [
      {
        "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
        "landmarks": [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], ...],
        "probability": 0.95,
        "timestamp": 1234567890
      },
      // ... 9 more samples
    ],
    "registeredAt": "2026-02-24T...",
    "sampleCount": 10
  }
}
```

### 🎯 Quick Commands:

**Check if server is running:**
```bash
# Server should show: "Server running on port 3000"
```

**View face data:**
```bash
# Check: db/data/face_data.json
```

**View your user data:**
```bash
# Check: db/data/users.json
# Your account should have "faceId" field after registration
```

### 🐛 Troubleshooting:

**Camera not starting?**
- Check browser permissions (Chrome → Settings → Privacy → Camera)
- Try different browser
- Ensure no other app is using camera

**Face not detected?**
- Improve lighting
- Move closer to camera
- Remove glasses/hat
- Center your face in the circle

**Verification failing?**
- Re-register with better lighting
- Ensure consistent conditions
- Check confidence scores in console (F12)

**Door not unlocking?**
- Check ESP32 is powered on
- Verify WiFi connection
- Check ESP32 IP address
- Upload Arduino code to ESP32

### 📱 ESP32 Integration:

**Current Status:** Server is ready, waiting for ESP32

**ESP32 Setup:**
1. Upload `esp32/door_control.ino` to ESP32
2. Connect to WiFi "Keerthi"
3. Note the IP address from Serial Monitor
4. Update server with ESP32 IP if needed

**Hardware Connections:**
- Servo Signal → GPIO 18
- Buzzer → GPIO 16
- Servo Power → External 5V supply
- Common Ground → All components
